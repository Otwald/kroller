# Leadership Tests
Morale tests are separate from Leadership Tests. Leadership tests use 2d6 and the result must be equal to or less than the selected unit's highest Ld value amongst all of its models. Any circumstance that allows one unit to use the Leadership of another for morale tests also applies to Leadership tests.

# Stratagems
- Core, Requisition and Wargear stratagems are unchanged.

- If the stratagem would require the user to select any of their units to receive a benefit, each unit must pass a leadership test in order to benefit from the stratagem. If no units pass their leadership test, or the user so chooses, the stratagem can "fail", and only 1 command point is subtracted from their available total. Failed stratagems do not count as being played for the sake of other rules that interact.

- If the stratagem does not require that any specific unit be selected for a benefit, then the user must pass a Leadership test on their warlord. If their warlord is not on the battlefield, then the user may pick any of their units to take the Leadership test.

# Psychic Powers
- Psychic powers are unaffected.

# Prayers
- Instead of rolling to see if a prayer succeeds, instead take a leadership test on the model attempting the prayer.

- If any rule would modify the prayer roll, multiply the effect of that rule by two (+1 to prayer rolls become +2, etc).

# Abilities
- If an ability of any unit or model requires you to select a friendly unit to receive a benefit, the unit who is using the ability must pass a leadership test.

- If an aura or an ability provides a benefit to friendly units within a range of it, each time a unit or model would benefit from this ability, the unit with the ability must pass a leadership test before the unit can receive the benefit. If the test is passed, the unit continues to receive the benefit until the end of the phase, for as long as all other conditions are valid. If a test was already taken for the benefitting model this phase, then another test may not be made.

For example, a Space Marine Captain is within 6" of Primaris Intercessors. The Primaris Intercessors are chosen to shoot. Rites of Battle (Aura) would apply to the first BS hit roll being made, so a leadership test must be passed by the Captain before continuing. The test is failed, so all subsequent hit rolls do not receive the benefit of Rites of Battle. Later, in the Fight Phase, the Primaris Intecessors are selected to fight. They are still within 6" of the Captain, and it is a different phase, so the Captain may make another leadership test when the Primaris Interccesors make their first WS hit roll.
