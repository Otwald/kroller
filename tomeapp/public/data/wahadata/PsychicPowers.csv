1|MASS HYPNOSIS|GC|Genestealer Cults|The psyker’s eyes glow strangely as they cast their gaze across their chosen victims, using mental dominion to put them into a trance-like state so the cult can take them apart at leisure.|Broodmind Discipline|Mass Hypnosis has a warp charge value of 7. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select an enemy unit within 18" of and visible to the psyker. Until the start of your next <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">Psychic phase</a>, the target cannot fire <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Overwatch">Overwatch</a>, fights last in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a> even if it charged, and must subtract 1 from its <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit rolls</a>. If the target has a rule that allows it to fight first in the Fight phase even if it did not charge, then instead of fighting last in the Fight phase, it fights as if it did not have that ability and did not charge.|
2|MIND CONTROL|GC|Genestealer Cults|Palsied fingers twitch and facial muscles spasm as the psyker’s chosen mark is taken over completely. Relegated to a mere passenger within their own body, they are forced to witness their own traitorous actions as they open fire upon their trusted comrades.|Broodmind Discipline|Mind Control has a warp charge value of 7. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select an enemy model within 12" of the psyker and roll 3D6. If the score is less than that model’s Leadership characteristic, nothing happens, but if it equals or exceeds it, that model can either shoot as if it were your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, or make a single close combat attack as if it were the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>. In either case, treat that model as if it were a separate unit that is part of your army whilst shooting or making that close combat attack. Models cannot attack themselves, but they can attack other members of their unit.|
3|PSIONIC BLAST|GC|Genestealer Cults|The psyker focuses the alien hatred of their kind into a blaze of pallid energies. Where their gaze falls, the enemy are consumed – the last thing they hear is a shrill screech of triumph.|Broodmind Discipline|Psionic Blast has a warp charge value of 5. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select an enemy unit within 18" of and visible to the psyker and roll 2D6. If the result is less than the highest Leadership characteristic in that unit, it suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>, otherwise it suffers D3 mortal wounds.|
4|MENTAL ONSLAUGHT|GC|Genestealer Cults|The psyker, well used to forcing their will upon those who would resist them, intensifies their hypnotic power to such a degree it can cause their victims’ brains to swell to bursting point inside their skulls.|Broodmind Discipline|Mental Onslaught has a warp charge value of 6. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select an enemy model within 18" of and visible to the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">psyker</a>. Each player then rolls a D6 and adds their model’s Leadership characteristic to their result. If your score is higher, the enemy model’s unit suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>; if the selected model is still alive you then repeat this process (each player rolling a D6 and adding their respective Leadership) until either the selected model is destroyed, your opponent rolls a 6, and/or your opponent’s result is equal to or higher than yours.|
5|PSYCHIC STIMULUS|GC|Genestealer Cults|The unknowable power of the cult’s gestalt soul flows into the psyker’s chosen instruments, spurring them into a religious frenzy that sees them attack with hyperactive speed.|Broodmind Discipline|Psychic Stimulus has a warp charge value of 6. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select a friendly GENESTEALER CULTS unit within 18" of the psyker. Until the start of your next <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">Psychic phase</a>, that unit can charge even if it <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance">Advanced</a> (though not if it <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back">Fell Back</a>) and they always fight first in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>, even if they didn’t charge. If your opponent has units that have charged, or that have a similar ability, then alternate choosing units to fight with, starting with the player whose turn is taking place.|
6|MIGHT FROM BEYOND|GC|Genestealer Cults|An alien strength lurks in every being that carries the Genestealer Curse. With a low whisper that rises to a scream, the psyker amplifies this hidden might, and their followers are swollen with empowering energy born of the void itself.|Broodmind Discipline|Might From Beyond has a warp charge value of 7. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select a friendly <span class="tooltip01471" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content01471" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content01471"><span class="kwb">GENESTEALER</span> <span class="kwb">CULTS</span> <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> or <span class="tooltip01783" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content01783" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content01783"><span class="kwb">BIKER</span></span> unit within 18" of the psyker.

2|EMPYRIC AMPLIFICATION|GK|Grey Knights|In ritualistic patterns, the psyker overlays a complex web of blessed, psychic amplification around the doomed foe. Matching the intricate martial methods of his brother knights, each strike with their psychically empowered weapons through this field drives more of their manifested power into the enemy.|Dominus Discipline|<b>Malediction:</b> <i>Empyric Amplification</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 7.

4|VORTEX OF DOOM|GK|Grey Knights|The psyker tears a rift between realspace and the warp, condemning his foes to total oblivion.|Dominus Discipline|<b>Witchfire:</b> <i>Vortex of Doom</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 7. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, select the closest enemy unit within 12" of and visible to this <span class="kwb">PSYKER</span>: each other enemy unit within 3" of the selected unit suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>, and then the selected unit suffers 2D3 mortal wounds. If the model manifesting this power has been selected this phase for the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/grey-knights/#Warlord-Traits-1">Psychic Epitome</a> Warlord Trait, only the unit you selected suffers the additional mortal wound from that trait, not those other enemy units within 3" of it.|

Your army’s currently dominant Tide of the Warp is changed to the selected Tide of the Warp.|
6|GHOSTLY BONDS|GK|Grey Knights|Subtly manipulating the invisible barrier separating the immaterium from the material realm, the psyker causes imperfect wrinkles and bulges within its fabric to gather around his opponents, pushing back against their advance and dragging at their momentum like a spiritual halter.|Dominus Discipline|<b>Malediction:</b> <i>Ghostly Bonds</i> has a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">warp charge</a> value of 5.

1|Incursion|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The psyker opens a portal to the Realm of Chaos, allowing the warp’s daemonic denizens to spill forth into reality.|Malefic Discipline|Incursion has a warp charge value of 7. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">psyker</a> can immediately attempt to summon a unit of DAEMONS to the battlefield using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/#Daemonic-Ritual">Daemonic Ritual</a> ability as if it were the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>. When doing so, roll up to 4 dice instead of up to 3. The psyker will not suffer any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> as a result of doubles or triples being rolled for this Daemonic Ritual.|
2|Sacrifice|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The psyker uses a sacrificial soul to remould and repair an unholy Daemon-form. The tainted spirits of Warpsmiths are particularly invigorating offerings to those Daemon Engines that are in their charge.|Malefic Discipline|Sacrifice has a warp charge value of 4.

3|Mutated Invigoration|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A wave of insanity and mutation flows from the psyker’s fingers, enveloping their Daemonkin allies with bountiful gifts.|Malefic Discipline|Mutated Invigoration has a warp charge value of 7.

4|Possession|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The psyker blasts away their enemy’s soul so that the spiritless shell left behind can be possessed by a Daemon, who quickly transforms it into a more pleasing form. Vehicles so possessed are typically unable to contain the Daemon within, and explode in a scream of empyric energy.|Malefic Discipline|Possession has a warp charge value of 5. If <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifested</a>, then until the start of your next <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">Psychic phase</a>, the Armour Penetration characteristic of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">psyker’s</a> melee weapons is improved by 2 (e.g. an AP of -1 becomes -3). Furthermore, until the start of your next Psychic phase, each time the psyker destroys an enemy INFANTRY CHARACTER in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>, you can add a <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/Chaos-Spawn">Chaos Spawn</a> model to your army. If the destroyed model was ADEPTUS ASTARTES or HERETIC ASTARTES, you can instead add a <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/Greater-Possessed">Greater Possessed</a> model to your army. If a new model is added to your army, set it up within 6" of the psyker and more than 1" from any enemy models. In addition, each time the psyker destroys an enemy VEHICLE model in the Fight phase that could explode, it automatically explodes; no dice roll is made and any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> suffered by the psyker in the resulting explosion are ignored.|
