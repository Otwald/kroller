##Update September 17th, 2022:
- You can now sort your forces by Name, Role, Costs, and by Squad Marker in the Force Settings tab in your force.
- To mark a squad, put a html hexidecimal color code as the beginning text in the Custom Notes of the unit you wish to mark (example: '#ff0000' will mark the unit in red).
- 40kroller converts your BattleScribe roster to a "kfon" data structure. You can download this file in the Force Settings tab in your Force. I don't know whay you would use this for, but it's there.

##Update September 1st, 2022:
- Improved subfaction detection and Stratagem Filtering.
- You can now edit custom notes in BattleScribe and add markdown and custom accordions as such:
\#[Header](Content)
- You can also use bold, italics, line break, headers, images, links, and CP and Dice with {0} and [0]
- Bracketting units now combine into one model, and most weapons now combine into one selector.
- Please leave feedback in the Game tab if something is not working for you! You can now also upload the problem roster file as well.
