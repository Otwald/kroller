## Bugs:
- unit link icons ONLY WORK IN CHROME (touch?)
- don't update tracker on swipe or spin
- T'au not found in factionLinks
- Not parsing Plagueburst crawlers (listed as upgrade and not unit)
? fix waha link builder with regex groups
- <brotherhood></brotherhood> in Greyknights
- Greyknights doesn't show built-in spell
- black templars subfaction not found
- can't copy output/gamecode by button on android
* Error in accordion when copying from button
* copy link/code/output

## Maybe?
- Add admin lock
- stream overlay view

## To Do:
- onclick tooltip
- paste game code to go to game
- setup tab (auto-open settings, reset, etc.)
- Chaplain/Priest spells
- Doctrine/Rites/C'tan powers listing
- detachment/army rules (Angels of Death, Sacred Rites, etc.)
- What can be highlighted or copied?
- Game/Force list? (Would require an admin lock)
- wound tracker/combine bracketing profiles
- combine duplicate weapons (blighthaulers)
- highlight warlord traits and relics
- competitive game clock
- combine spinner and swiper
- Custom model names
- Expand API lookup
- data collection
- discord trying to render image attachments
- Discord Bot
- Calculator/Simulator
- Load calculator from list view (fix model and weapon amounts first)
- Add more subfactions to factions icons
- Daily download/cleaning
- accounts? / discord login
- OPR list viewer
- GW Image Scraper
- Ability Map
- 2.5D simulator game
- Battlescribe ingestor (with classes/constructors)
- Battlescribe read direct or search on wahapedia
~ tech priest control panel (needs more tools/logger)
~ Game tracker (needs scorebaord and syncing)

~ Wahapedia download/ingestor (automated)
~ Logger for debug (Doesn't show complete sql errors)
